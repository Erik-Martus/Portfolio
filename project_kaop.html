        <p>Seniors at Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational High School are expected to produce a capstone project in their vocational area over the course of their senior year that demonstrates the skills they have developed during their education. For Multimedia Communication, students must seek out clients in need of some form of design work.</p>

        <p>At the end of my Junior Year I was approached by Adele Ellis, the underclassmen instructor in my vocational area with an idea of pitching a new program to educate youth in the area about the dangers of online predators. Over the course of my senior year I worked closely with her to build a cohesive campaign from the ground up.</p>

        <p>Essentially, my goal was to build an organization similar to D.A.R.E., a drug prevention program targeted towards American youth, but instead focused on online predators. Though the project never went live, and not what I would consider to be my "finest" work, it demonstrates my creative process from start to finish through several final deliverables including a website coded using HTML and CSS that contained both a children's section and a parent/guardian's section that presented similar information, but in terms geared for each demographic. Additionally, I developed a logo, established a general brand identity, an email template, and a handout pamphlet. The initial intent was to meet with the Wocester County District Attorney's office and present my work and potentially put it live on the web as well as introduce the program to local police departments, but our contact with the office fell through and the project did not move forward.</p>
