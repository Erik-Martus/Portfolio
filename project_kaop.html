        <p>Over the course of my senior year at Blackstone Valley Tech I worked with the underclassmen instructor of Multimedia Communications, Adele Ellis, to build a cohesive campaign from the ground up.</p>

        <p>Essentially, my goal was to build an organization similar to D.A.R.E., a drug prevention program targeted towards American youth, but instead focused on online predators. Though the project never went live, and not what I would consider to be my "finest" work, it demonstrates my creative process from start to finish through several final deliverables including a website hand coded using HTML and CSS that contained both a children's section and a parent/guardian's section that presented similar information, but in terms geared for each demographic. Additionally, I developed a logo, established a general brand identity, an email template, and a handout pamphlet. The initial intent was to meet with the Wocester County District Attorney's office and present my work and potentially put it live on the web as well as introduce the program to local police departments, but our contact with the office fell through and the project did not move forward.</p>
