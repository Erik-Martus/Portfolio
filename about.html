        <p>Small town to big city. I grew up halfway between the not so wonderful city of Worcester, MA, pronounced Wooster for those of you not from the area, and the more exciting city of Providence, RI in the small town of Douglas, MA located right in the crook of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island meet.</p>

        <p>I got my real start in design during high school. I was fortunate was able to attend Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School, which is a mouthful so we just called it BVT, I encourage you to look them up they usually put out some pretty nifty things. My trade was Multimedia Communications, the teachers there encouraged me to push past my comfort zone and I discovered my passions for creating something from nothing other than my own imagination and thinking about why someone is motivated to do something when they interact with technology.</p>

        <p>I was fortunate enough to be accepted into Drexel University's Game Design and Production program. I was excited, but it was also a stretch for me to be so far from home and everything and everyone I had ever known. Given time though Drexel proved to be the right choice, though not for reasons I had anticipated even considering the bumps I encountered along the way. By the end of my first quarter I knew that game design was not going to work out for me, 3D modeling is a beast unlike anything I have ever attempted and suffice to say it was not my (IDM). I honestly had never heard of the major, but I found that it was exactly what I had been looking for, and so after a brief period of thinking it over I put in to switch majors and I have never looked back.</p>

        <p>IDM has allowed me to combine my passions of design and technology in ways I never would have anticipated, and I am only just getting started. I look forward to gaining the knowledge and tools to push the boundaries of my interests to new heights. Along with my major in IDM I am minoring in Psychology and I have the intent to pick up another minor along with it, though that one is still TBD at the moment.</p>
